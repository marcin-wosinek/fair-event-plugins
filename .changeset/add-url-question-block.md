Add a URL question block (mirrors the email question) that renders a mobile-friendly text input on the frontend, normalizes bare domains to `https://`, and rejects non-web values server-side. Stored answers render as links in the submission-detail and questionnaire-responses admin views. Also fixes the url and email questions never appearing in the block inserter inside Event Signup (fair-audience and fair-events), and extracts the question-block allow-list into fair-events-shared so fair-form-conditional stays in sync.
