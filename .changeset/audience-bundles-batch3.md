Move the galleries and messaging bundles out of `fair-audience` into the `fair-audience-experimental` companion, gated behind their `Features::is_enabled()` flags (issue #1041). `PhotoParticipant`/`GalleryAccessKey` and `CustomMailMessage`/`ExtraMessage`/`ScheduledMessage` (plus their repositories, controllers, admin pages, media-library hooks, and the scheduled-message cron) are renamed to `FairAudienceExperimental\…` and now travel with the companion; every cross-plugin call site (`fair-events-experimental`'s gallery endpoint, stable `fair-events`' gallery page, `fair-form`'s questionnaire photo tagging, and core `fair-audience`'s email service and anonymization service) degrades gracefully via `class_exists()` guards when the companion is inactive.
