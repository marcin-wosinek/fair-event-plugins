The plugin uses advanced CSS container queries for responsive design and WordPress's block context system for seamless data inheritance between parent and child blocks.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/fair-timetable` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. In the Gutenberg editor, find the "Timetable" block in the design category.
4. Add the timetable container block to your post or page.
5. Add timetable columns within the container.
6. Add time slots within each column and configure your events.
7. Set global time settings (start time, end time, hour height) in the timetable container.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do the time settings work? =

Time settings are defined once in the timetable container block and automatically inherited by all columns within it. This ensures consistency across your entire schedule.

= Can I have different time ranges for different columns? =

When columns are placed inside a timetable container, they inherit the parent's time settings for consistency. For different time ranges, use separate timetable containers or standalone timetable columns.

= Can I customize the visual appearance? =

Yes! The plugin provides three hour height options (Small, Medium, Large) for visual scaling, and all blocks follow WordPress styling standards for theme compatibility.

= Will this work with my theme? =

The plugin is designed to work with any properly coded WordPress theme. It uses WordPress's standard block wrapper and follows WordPress coding standards.

= How are time slots positioned? =

Time slots calculate their position automatically based on the timetable's start time and the slot's start time, creating precise visual alignment in your schedule.
